# Bucket Sort

Distributes elements into a number of buckets, each of
which is then sorted, either using a different sorting
algorithm or by recursively applying the bucket sort
algorithm.


## Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case, but often
linear O(n) when elements are uniformly distributed.
